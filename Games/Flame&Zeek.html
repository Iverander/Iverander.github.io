            <p>
                During the development time I was responsible for making sure the game got it's online connectivity. 
                I was given a week to succeed if i failed we wouldve abandoned the networking part of the game. 
                At the time I used <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922">PUN2</a> to handle the server side.
