            <p>
                During the development time of Polyglot Kitchen my primary contribution was as the lead programmer where i assigned the programmer and myself to different tasks.
                My programming tasks was primarily handling the translation of the game and the customer interactions.
                In addition to programming i also designed the level of the game and was responsible for resolving git issues.
