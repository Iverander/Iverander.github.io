            <h1>The Team</h1>

            <p>This project was a part of Nord's gamelab course. We decided we wanted to make a parkour game and thought it would work best within VR.</p>

            <p>
                During the development time of Spring~Boy my primary contribution was as the lead programmer where i assigned the programmer and myself to different tasks.
                My programming tasks was primarily handling the VR momevement and locomotion, "throwing" your hands and enemies.
                In addition to programming i also designed the level of the game and was responsible for resolving git issues.
